C&M Mining Machines Reservation System

Overview
The C&M Mining Machines Reservation System is a console-based Java application designed to manage customer records for a mining machine reservation service. The system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customer records, manage inventory details, and calculate costs for reserved items. The application uses file-based storage to persist customer data.

  - Search Customer by ID: Quickly find and display a customerâ€™s record.
  - Update Customer Records: Modify existing customer details.
  - Delete Customer Records: Remove a customer record from the system.
- Price Calculation: Automatically calculate the total cost based on item price and quantity.
- User-Friendly Menu: Navigate through the options with a simple numbered menu.
- File Persistence: Customer data is stored in a text file, ensuring records persist even after closing the program.

Project Structure
- Main Class: KHALIL.java
